//this.title=title; // this.title is a global variable, and title is local variable
	 title=filmtitle;//This is similar to this.title=filmtitle,but using this.prefix is not compulsary
	 director=filmdirector;//This is similar to this.director=filmdirector,but using this.prefix is not compulsary
	 // as there are no local variables by name title, or director 
	 // so, here they will implicitly referred to global variable
	// not: if title and  director are not globally declare then it will be undeclared variable cannot be local variable
	 //if the parameter names are similar to the global variables
	 //then there is an ambiguity between the local variable (parameter) and global variable
	 //hence this.prefix is used for referring the global variable
	 //title=title will be referring the local variable on both side of the = operator(x=x)self assigning
